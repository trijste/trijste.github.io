	<blogentry>I love getting e_mails from friends in far off places.  </P><P>Aside from that, I woke up early this morning for an 8:30 am doctor's appointment.  Everything went well.  I took my medical form for Katimavik an got him to fill it out.  He said that without a note from my shrink that said functioning fine and would do well in the program, I probably wouldn't get in based on the information that was there.  SO I have to wait a while longer to get all that funky stuff done.  Phone calls and faxes.  I had to get some blood work done, which isn't the funnest way to spend a morning.  Three vials.  </P><P>But my mom took me to the downtown Long and Mcquade afterwards, and I got my sax tuned and fixed up.  I met the repair man, Frank, who I slipped ten bucks for servicing and repairing the missing neck screw.  He said to bring it in any time.  I got to watch him work on it a little bit.  He showed me the leakey pads by sticking a light into the horn and bell and fingering the keys.  If light was coming through, it needed a quick screw.  My mom bought me a new book to learn at some point, and a comfortable neck harness, and even a stand so I don't have to lay it on the couch all the time.  I met Arthur's brother, Barnaby (Arthur's my sax teacher) and he threw me a card and a few free reeds.  It was a pleasant experience.  My mom did some more shopping--buying food mostly.  Then we came home and had a tea and a few rugelah.  We went out to do some more errands and now we're back.  I got some school supplies for my courses in the fall, and she got to photocopy a picture I took in Italy tat she really likes.  I cam home and practiced on my horn and it definately sounds better.  Now I just need to think about getting a new mouthpiece some time.  I am bored and writing a boring entry.  I'm going to go to Jenny's tomorrow night for her birthday party, so I'm going to burn her a CD.  I'm working Sunday, so I'll miss Zippy's birthday, which kinda sucks 'cause I have a gift for him, but work don't come around too often, and I'm already hooked into it.  </P><P>I chilled with Ashley last night, and also Dion.  It was nice to see them, but I hate spending the day downtown doing nothing.  I read a lot. </P><P>I really have nothing to say.  I'm just typing shit.</P><P>My sister was on a television program that we got the tape of today, so we watched it, and it was nice to see her, even if it was on the TV.  I miss having her around, and look forward to seeing her when she gets home in November.  Things will be different.</P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
