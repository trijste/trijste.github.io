	<span class="title"><blogtitle>flight dream</blogtitle></span>
	
	<div class="body">
	<blogentry>a couple nights ago I had a good dream that involved flight.  It was sunny out side in a park in a city environment.  I was with a couple friends but younger in countenance and action.  An older women had thin silver reflective wings that were worn as a consumable and enabled flight by the basics of arm flapping and running.  She gave them to me, or let me try them out and it was the coolest thing.  I started running and flapping my arms with these silver wings on them, and I lifted off.  I rose on a current and felt the feeling of flight through the dream.  It was pretty damn cool and really memorable, as I am able to recall the situation and feeling days later, which is rare for my dreams.  I would assume flight to be a powerful metaphor for an archetypal idea that was being communicated to me by my unconscious, but I am beyond the searching out of those bits of information.  If I sit with it I assume it to come to me.  The coolest thing was the difference of feeling in my dream from my state on the ground to my state in the air.  I felt so light and free--like swimming, only the resistance of the water would be like air, so much more free, and I could breath rationaly.  Sometimes when I dream of swimming I can breath under water and that seperates the dream from reason in my mind, or in my mind, but in the air it was beautiful and warm.  A nice way to wake up, but I wish I could do it again.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
