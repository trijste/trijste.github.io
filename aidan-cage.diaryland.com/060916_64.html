	<blogentry>in addition to that long last one, I watched Tristan and Isolde for the first time tonight.  Even now the music from the credits swells up around me as I type.  I have grown up forever hearing of this story--people hear my name and pass mention of it as if to explain the sounds my mouth makes as I introduce myself.  It is so hard to watch it with this in mind.  It is such a high drama--so much entwined intimacy and situation, love, war and duty.  Beautiful images, people, acting, story, history, lives--Ridley Scott was involved, though he did not direct.  I am moved by it, in as much as I have been followed by it--haunted.  Wagner wrote for it too, which I will see someday--maybe in Toronto at the new house.  I want a Djarum, but they are all gone.  Smoking sucks, but those ones are just hard to put out.  I have no desire to be a smoker, yet to sit and have a Djarum smoothly burning holes in my lungs--somehow this I crave.  I'd like to study Tritan and Isolde.  I'd like to study anything other than what I am currently.  I am going to class because I know this is the first half of the first yar, and it is always like this.  I will talk to my English professor about this story.  Tomorrow I must do a draft of my essay for her class, and read for all my others.  Tristan and Isolde revealed--in as much as what I watched did reveal it to me.  Well done.</p><p>LOVE - Tristan<BR>PS-I want to make mention of the isolation I have out here, because it has come up.  I am really alone, in as much as I was not alone at home.  I have no close bonds here, save Luna the cat who sometimes seeks my attention.  It is not a burning desire to make bonds, but every day I turn to pass the joke on, and there is no one.  I am just laughing to myself.  It has almost stopped being funny.  I sit now on level with everything else in my room.  There is no sense of elevation.  I get home and sit on the floor with everything else.  It means nothing, but I know when my bed comes, and I get that desk up here, and that char, and bedside table, and a couple clothes baskets, and posters and a lamp to read by, I will be eased so much.  I will have comfort beyond the comfort of things, even as I get these things.  I will have the comfort of a reason to set things up for myself.  What reason have I in this transition?  I think that could be key too, this sense of continuing transition, so that even as I am transitioning back into school, I come home and find I have yet to fully transition into my space.  This picks away at my sense of awareness.  It does, I swear, because I wake up on the floor with a sore body, and return to my bed in the evening--arranging my pillows and laying into the night.  I am unsure of how to word this, so I will stop.  I just feel off, and it is reflected in some things I am doing, and I don't want to freethought fifteen pages of free hand to find it.  I want to dream it and type it clearer.  It is a coupling of the anxiety I feel for being on a schedule again (and having actual 'to dos,' where last year I had nothing but continued social convalescence), with the lack of personal identity at home--but it feels weak to say that I cannot pull myself from the reflections of me that would be present when I am more settled.  I would need to pull that from inside anyway.  I think the feelings I have are based largely on loneliness, and absent communication--mostly text messaging, or not knowing the names of the people I have spent more than two sentances worth with.  I have to refine myself harder to get at the base courses and find what is real in what I am hearing/reading about all week.  I am tying to get involved, and this is a sacrifice for me, because I don't know if it is purposeful fully.  I am unclear.</blogentry><BR><BR>
