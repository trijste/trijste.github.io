	<blogentry>Pauly moops!</p><p>A girl I have cared for recently reminds me of your own passion for <br>particulars in women.  Her name is Krista and she's from Ottawa.  She <br>holds that image of one whose teenage years have been spent filling <br>her mind and body with an endless supply of drugs and dancing late <br>nights away to loud music.  She is beautiful.  I know you have shared <br>feelings for this specimen of drug culture in our speicies.  I care <br>dearly for her.<br>I have arrived in Weyburn, SK just last night after a long day of <br>flying.  I drove from Sydney to Halifax at 1:30am, caught a plane <br>from Halifax to Toronto at 10:55am, took another plane from Toronto <br>to Calgary at 3:20pm, and took a plane from Calgary to Regina at <br>7:20pm.  Once we landed in Regina, we had to wait till almost 11pm to <br>board a bus that would take us to our new, temporary home.  I crossed <br>three time zones.  I developed a high fever in Toronto, which is what <br>happens when you kiss a beautiful girl who is party sick from her last <br>days in Sydney.  She told me she was sick and that she didn't want me <br>to get sick, but I didn't care at the time, and still think it was <br>worth it as my throat burns.  I bought some Tylenol in Calgary and <br>that helped me out.  On my way into Toronto, my ears refused to pop <br>as we decended and felt as if they would explode.  It was <br>excrucatingly painful for a little while, but they seem to be ok now. <br>  I am one third finished this crazy year.  It is incredibly good for <br>me, yet terribly bad at the same time.<br>I got your number from someone so I'll call you sometime when I get a <br>phone card.</p><p>PEACE - Tristan<br><HR><br>As if leaving you at the airport wasn't torture enough, I had to suffer through 24 hours of travel.  It wasn't as if you were far away, though.  My sore throat evolved into a high fever at some point in the Toronto airport.  I found out rather solemnly that you had flown into Terminal 1, and I sadly had flown into Terminal 2 and was unable to truly say goodbye.  It had to be better that way; a long goodbye only rots the fruit of loving relationships.  Did I just type that eloquent, archaic trash?  You'd better get used to it.  I am a motherfucker on these keys!  I miss you.  You are such a brightness in my mind.  Let me know your first impressions of Blind River.  Weyburn is a flat, hot shit hole so far.  I wandered it's dusty streets today in porous travel fever.  It is much larger than Cheticamp, but I imagine Blind River to be much smaller than Sydney.  You are such a city girl, with your late night party lust--I wonder how you will take the quiet, still serenity of that wilderness.  I am brewing a ginseng-ginger tea as I type to help destroy this lovely bug you have shared with me.  I am honestly happy to have it, as it would have meant not kissing you to be bug free.  moops!  bif yo mckother pton s klay knew.
