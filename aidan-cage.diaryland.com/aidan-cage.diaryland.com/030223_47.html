	<blogentry>I finally realized how bored I am all the time.  It's one thing to choose not to work a bad job--making money so you can buy food you shouldn't have to pay for and could easily steal, but that one thing splits when you have all this extra time because you don't work and you do nothing proactive with your time.  I sit around a lot.  I slept a lot today.  I took my dog for a walk and that tired me out so I had another snooze.  I think I'm suffering from some form of chronic boredom that perpetually creates itself because it destroys my ambition.  I gotta get goin on at least a few things.  I don't know how I can forget these things!  If I want to make any decent festivals, I have to start submitting.  If I want to have a decent script to show if I get any interest, I need to start writing.  If I don't want to live in a shithole, I need to clean my room.  I just have to start.  I think I did today, but it came late.  I need to find a job now.  I need to have money now because so many festivals require cash to submit.  I have just enough to make my dubs and not enough to send any.  Earthroots?  I think I may.  It would mean trying to do a strange kind of job that I've never done before, but the hours are my own and the money is more than the nothing I make now.  </P><P>I e_mailed my producer to try and get him back in on the film wagon.  It would be nice to have some help getting this thing out there, but he seems to be less than helpful.  I hope I can get some help from him.  He did get the credit, only the partial credit because I did a lot of the producing as well.  Whatever.  I will live on in defiance of all that presents itself against my grain.  I will fall through the wind in whatever direction I pretend to choose.  Everything else guides me.  Even my thoughts are endlessly choosing paths.  I'm walking in six thousand directions.  I don't know where I am and I am only slightly conscious of where I've been.  My life is a mess somehow, and It's time to clean up.  But tonight I sleep.  And tomorrow I travel.  And still I think I think too much--too much I think I'm thinking.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
