	<blogentry>The Lovers<br>The lovers say nothing. <br>Love is the finest of the silences, <br>the one that trembles most and is hardest to bear. <br>The lovers are looking for something. <br>The lovers are the ones who abandon, <br>the ones who change, who forget. <br>Their hearts tell them that they will never find. <br>They don't find, they're looking. <br>The lovers wander around like crazy people <br>because they're alone, alone, <br>surrendering, giving themselves to each moment, <br>crying because they don't save love. <br>They worry about love. The lovers <br>live for the day, it's the best they can do, it's all they know. <br>They're going away all the time, <br>all the time, going somewhere else. <br>They hope, <br>not for anything in particular, they just hope. <br>They know that whatever it is they will not find it. <br>Love is the perpetual deferment, <br>always the next step, the other, the other. <br>The lovers are the insatiable ones, <br>the ones who must always, fortunately, be alone. </p><p>The lovers are the serpent in the story. <br>They have snakes instead of arms. <br>The veins in their necks swell <br>like snakes too, suffocating them. <br>The lovers can't sleep <br>because if they do the worms ear them. </p><p>They open their eyes in the dark <br>and terror falls into them. </p><p>They find scorpions under the sheet <br>and their bed floats as though on a lake. </p><p>The lovers are crazy, only crazy <br>with no God and no devil. </p><p>The lovers come out of their caves <br>trembling, starving, <br>chasing phantoms. <br>They laugh at those who know all about it, <br>who love forever, truly, <br>at those who believe in love as an inexhaustible lamp. </p><p>The lovers play at picking up water, <br>tattooing smoke, at staying where they are. <br>They play the long sad game of love. <br>None of them will give up. <br>The lovers are ashamed to reach any agreement. </p><p>Empty, but empty from one rib to another, <br>death ferments them behind the eyes, <br>and on they go, they weep toward morning <br>in the trains, and the roosters wake into sorrow. </p><p>Sometimes a scent of newborn earth reaches them, <br>of women sleeping with a hand on their sex, contented, <br>of gentle streams, and kitchens. </p><p>The lovers start singing between their lips <br>a song that is not learned. <br>And they go on crying, crying <br>for beautiful life. </p><p>                                  Jaime Sabines<br>
