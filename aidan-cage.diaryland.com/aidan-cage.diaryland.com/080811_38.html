	<blogentry>Monday, March 1, 2004 -- Sunnybrook Hospital</p><p>It was about mid day.  I had managed to pee on a blanket and wrap myself in it.  You were the nice nurse who liked my drawing, and my singing voice, and you told me I was very smart.<br>Thanks again!</p><p>Tuesday, March 2, 2004 -- Sunnybrook Hospital</p><p>You were knitting in my room when I woke up.  It had been a long night.  You took me to get a tea in the atrium, and were very sweet.  Sorry I tried to escape!  Where can I find that hat pattern?<br>Give me a call.</p><p>Tuesday, March 9, 2004 -- Bethune C.I.</p><p>You were in a crowd of students gathered in the foyer during a lunch break.  I walked in and took off my clothes, looking for answers.  Hope I didn't offend.<br>What are you up to?</p><p>Tuesday, March 9, 2004 -- Scarborough Grace Hospital Emergency</p><p>You probably didn't see me.  I came in with some cuts on my face, wearing leg irons.  I was waiting to see a doctor.  You were in another room, and had voices singing, "For He's A Jolly Good Fellow" to you.  <br>How are things?</p><p>Saturday, March 13, 2004 -- CAMH Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.</p><p>You were pretty, in a nice skirt and sweater, and you had nice glasses.  I was wearing comfortable, bright red pyjamas, and blue flip flops.  I told you that the map-of-the-universe jigsaw puzzle in the common room was missing pieces.  You asked me how I knew that.  How did you know that?  It was nice talking with you.  <br>Hope you're doing well! </blogentry><BR><BR>
