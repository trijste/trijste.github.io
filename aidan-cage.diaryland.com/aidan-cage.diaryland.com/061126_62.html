	<blogentry>I was drunk this morning.  I took a cab to a house party way out in never-been-there-land at around midnight thirty, and started in on gin by one.  It was Blaine's birthday.  I don't know Blaine, but his party was a major spectacle.  I apologized to a girl, for giving her more attention then I felt I should have had I known she had a boyfriend.  Is that abstract?  I don't think I have ever done that, but I honestly felt bad.  I like to flirt and have a good time, give attention to people and make sure we are both having fun; but I thought I had maybe over-stepped a social line.  I think I am just uncool, in as much as cool is remaining normal, not addressing your awareness.  I am not normal, because telling someone you are sorry for giving the kind of attention you did, not knowing they were seeing someone, didn't feel normal, or make normal.  I just wanted to make sure nothing would be rifted (which isn't a word).  I cant even explain it.  Oh well, she was cute, I'm a mess--she said something like, "you think I'm interesting," which was great, because I did, and we were both drunk; that was when I was like "yeah, sorry about..."</p><p>I walked home with, and slept on the couch of three beautiful, young girls.  I woke up feeling like shit.  I had drank the bigger half of my bottle of gin in two drinks.  Both were out of a mason jar, and both were wetted with water (both were drank pretty quickly too, and in succession).  In any case, today I am excusably lazy.  <br>I watched "Slacker," by Richard Linklater.  I had downloaded it after realizing I had never watched it in full.  It is rewarding beyond my memory of it, and recommended.  I am currently not doing Spanish homework, or paper editing.  Good bye.</p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
