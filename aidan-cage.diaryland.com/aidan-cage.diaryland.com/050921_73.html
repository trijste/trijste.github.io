	<blogentry>I'm thinking about locking my diary, so if you are intereseted in continuing the reading, please send me your e_mail address and I will add you to my list.</p><p>I had my first appointment with dr. Paps since I have been back in town yesterday.  It went so much better than expected.  I talked about everything and was open and honest, so I didn't have to lie like I thought I would.  He explained the ODSP theory and cleared my mind of any guilt as long as I remain honest with my earnings.  We talked about medication and I admitted that I havn't been taking the pills regularly for two months (but I figure it has been more like six).  I told him I have only been taking them to get a good nights sleep.  He admitted that the drug levels in my blood would be non therapeutic at this point and that everything was really good considering that.  He asked what I wanted to do and I told him I would like to be prescribed for the 2.5mg's and decide then wether or not I would take them.  I took one last night and had a 13 hour sleep marathon that involved a dream about forgetting Christmas and having to run around and get gifts.  I was in a store that sold Native crafts and I was looking at this sweatshirt that had a red face mask and red feathers and it zipped up and it was really stupid, but I was looking at it and thinking about getting it for my grandmother.  I didn't.  It was strange.  I could have slept all the way through to my hair cut appointment at five, but I got up with disgust at wasting my day.  I'm not sure that I will try to keep up with the medication.  Part of me wants to as a safety blanket, but so much of me wants to be cold and alive.</p><p>That is it.  Kirsten and I is a more private story, but things are doing better, I feel, than before.</p><p>I get the internet soon at my place.  I am considering giving up the diaryland experience.  I want to concentrate my writing on another format than journal entries.  Plus half of my entries are not even able to be accessed anymore, which probably means I would have to pay to get them, and if I'm thinking about giving it up, I would not begin to pay for it.  </p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
