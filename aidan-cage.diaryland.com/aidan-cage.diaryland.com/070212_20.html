	<blogentry>Two dreams this weekend.  The first was about me losing my shoes in a mall.  The shoes apparently were taken by a couple thugs, who I approached seeking to get them back.  They were laughing. I had left my keys in one of the shoes.  They threw the mangled keyring back to me.  I didn't stop to notice whether or not I was wearing shoes.  It was more the idea of having something that was mine taken from me.  I saw Chris Brown (from Wex) somewhere in the mall crowd.  I didn't stop to speak to him.  <br>Dream two was more strange.  My body died at some point and I was dead.  The rest of the dream was me experiencing the afterlife.  There were two entities guiding me.  One of them felt like a sister.  The other was unclear.  They told me they wouldn't leave, and that they had always been with me.  I felt ok.  I looked up at a cliff across the river.  There were very white-skinned humans positioned like lizards in odd ways along the cliff face near the bottom (upside down).  they seemed docile and nonthreatening.  I was in a small shack type thing on the other side of the river.  <br>I woke up oddly through the night.  <br>I feel well rested, and was even early to my first class today (!); but I woke up half way through the night and couldn't drift back off.  Josie was trying to fool me by putting plastic pop bottle caps into my moccasins.  I had to shoo her out and close the door.  She cried and tried to get back in.  I was awake for both alarms.  I found the caps in my moccs and laughed to myself.  Later, when Josie was in the room again, she looked expectedly at my moccasins to see if her joke was still set.  I showed her there was nothing in my shoes, and then dug the caps out of my waste basket and tossed them on the floor to show her I had seen her little joke.  I also told her to let me sleep next time.</p><p>Strange dreams.</p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
