	<blogentry>Dear Erin</P><P></P><P>				There is a bond between us.  In time, we have grown to know each </P><P></P><P>other well, we have shared so much of our lives with each other, but </P><P></P><P>we've drifted.  We are not together;  we are not whole--you know this.</P><P></P><P> 			I could never really live in the city.  Ever since an early age I </P><P></P><P>could always feel myself pulling away.  There was something stiff in the </P><P></P><P>air--everyone always walking around like they taste cough syrup </P><P></P><P>in everything.  I remember the first time I saw a dollar bill--the first </P><P></P><P>time I felt a coin in my hand.  There was a coldness to it--in the faces </P><P></P><P>on the bills.  A chill in the weight of the metal in my hand.  It took my </P><P></P><P>heat, the warmth of my hand to give it value.  A value worth trading for </P><P></P><P>life's essentials--food, shelter, warmth at night.  But also other </P><P></P><P>things--new essentials, automobiles, refrigerators, house insurance, </P><P></P><P>television, paxil, Zoloft, welbutrin, a second closet, second house--a </P><P></P><P>second life.   The city is a rat maze with exit signs glaring red all </P><P></P><P>around.  It's hard to remember, but I remember you.  With your help I </P><P></P><P>threw it off.  Now I'm free.</P><P></P><P>				I quit my job and started reading full time at the library.  I took </P><P></P><P>notes.  I dreamt of places where value was in the action, not the </P><P></P><P>price--where victory was always in the attempt.  I yearned for a freedom </P><P></P><P>outside of shopping malls, a freedom I couldn't vote for.  It didn't take </P><P></P><P>long till I discovered what I needed.  Money is not necessary for the </P><P></P><P>gathering of life's essentials.  Food is easily obtained from grocery </P><P></P><P>storefronts, food courts, shallow dumpster dives--it isn't where you look </P><P></P><P>as much as how you look at it.  The Gulls don't pay for food, and they're </P><P></P><P>still flying free. Sometimes I have enough to share, sometimes I don't.</P><P></P><P>				I like to keep moving, and not just because I love to travel.  It's </P><P></P><P>all free now.  I can go anywhere.  I can hitchhike, I can hide inside a </P><P></P><P>flatbed, I can hop onto boxcars and watch the land pass away.  You get a </P><P></P><P>real sense of movement, and the movement of life around you when you're </P><P></P><P>staring at it from the open side of a boxcar.  Every little movement of </P><P></P><P>the train you feel inside.  Every little bump and grind.  When I arrive, </P><P></P><P>I immerse myself and observe.  I don frightening costumes, to fill my </P><P></P><P>stomach and mind. </P><P></P><P>				I have a suit I picked up from behind goodwill.  It demands </P><P></P><P>impeccable service from hotels, and lets me eat, laugh, and applaud from </P><P></P><P>my seat next to the food troughs at weddings.</P><P></P><P>				This pizza bag works like a ticket at stage doors.  The pizza man is </P><P></P><P>always welcome.  Sometimes I feel invincible.  </P><P></P><P>				A security guard is always needed at concerts or on set; just a word </P><P></P><P>on a shirt and a whole craft table to myself.</P><P></P><P>				I'm also a Janitor,</P><P></P><P>				Stock boy,</P><P></P><P>				Orderly,</P><P></P><P>				Construction worker.</P><P></P><P>				These characters help me survive.  I keep them all here.  This is </P><P></P><P>where I live.  The city supplies me with food, clothing, and shelter all </P><P></P><P>free of charge.  It isn't much, but I don't want much--just enough to </P><P></P><P>live.  Sometimes when I can't sleep, it gets so lonely here, but I always </P><P></P><P>feel better when I think of you.  We had such good times together--always </P><P></P><P>helping each other and laughing.  But you went away.  Oh god Erin.  We </P><P></P><P>understood each other so well, but you couldn't agree.  You thought some </P><P></P><P>of my methods were wrong.</P><P></P><P>				I guess you've already figured out why I'm writing you. I want to </P><P></P><P>tell you and show you how much I've changed--how I've seen and learned </P><P></P><P>things here that give a new light to what I'm trying to do.  Something's </P><P></P><P>out of place in this world.  It took me a little while to understand it, </P><P></P><P>but its here now.  Its money.  Money is the shit--the dirt under the </P><P></P><P>nails.  The whole concept is killing me--the math; the metaphor.  I'm an </P><P></P><P>animal.  You and I are animals, and we don't need money to survive.  I </P><P></P><P>hope you can understand me.  I need you to go on.  I look forward to </P><P></P><P>seeing you soon.</P><P></P><P>									Until then,</P><P></P><P>				'gasp' he he hahaha.  Of all the things to find in a lunchbox, </P><P></P><P>worthless paper--money.  Whose joke is this?  Who's laughing at me right </P><P></P><P>now?  Why is this here for me--to tempt me?  Does life want me to open a </P><P></P><P>bank account?  He haha.  Not likely.  I know money--I know money.  What </P><P></P><P>is the value of this moment, in this place, with this--money?  How much </P><P></P><P>can something like this hold?  How rich am I right now?</P><P></P><P>				What would Erin do with this?  Would he take it?  Would he start a </P><P></P><P>new life with a new house and a new car?  Would he have lots of friends?  </P><P></P><P>Would people like me?</P><P></P><P>				'hey'   -->   'gasp'  'Aaron?'  yes--yes.  </P><P></P><P>				Know Thyself</P><P></P><P>				oh god--oh god!</P><P></P><P>				PS --what happened to us?  How could we drift so far apart? The </P><P></P><P>cold--the cold.  I feel it now--rejuvenating, understanding.  I had </P><P></P><P>forgotten about Love--about the pain of loneliness, about you </P><P></P><P>Aaron--about us.  You have it now.  You have the gift, the warmth, the </P><P></P><P>life.  Take it from me, yes, take it from me--from the city.  'cough'</P><P></P><P>				It's colder now.  It's so cold.  I can't get out anymore--I can't get </P><P></P><P>out!  But you can--you can, and I know you will--I know; I know.  </P><P></P><P>Remember me.  Goodbye.</P><P></P><P></P><P>														Love Aaron</P><P></blogentry><BR><BR>
