	<blogentry>Another strange dream, or I guess I should just say dream as they are all strange in their own way.  I was frequenting a parlour to smoke with friends while travelling.  At one point, my stash fell out of my pocket while on route to a specific safe place to spin and blaze.  I walked back looking for it and found a group of younger kids burning near the entrance of the place, which seemed a little bait.  I confronted the one I knew had my stuff.  He had a guilty look on his face.  A girl defended him saying I didn't know he had my stuff.  I told her I did now because she wouldn't have known about my stuff from the way I confronted them.  I said it was cool as long as he would smoke me one.  He said cool and I took his stuff and went to spin, but then narcotics officers came around to my special place and I had to run.  I got away, but then they came back and I had to run some more.  I stashed the stuff under a couch while they weren't looking and then ran for it.  I had to throw these guys over my shoulder to slow them down so I was running and grabbing arms to throw bodies.  Which is the end.  The plot is not so interesting from my angle of presentation, but the tension I felt during the course of the dream was beautifully real.  You can only live your dreams on certain levels of 'real' I feel, and that emotional level is one that keeps pushing through.  Is tension an emotion?</P><P></P><P>I went to Ben's final class at Improv. and Playmaking or something, and I watched his class' last day presentations of their four week assignments.  An interesting place to put myself in for observation.  I really like performance, but I love the raw and amature that I feel gives the boldest and most awkward metaphors of communication.  </P><P>Always with the green devil under a lung or two and pushing from scene to scene.</P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
