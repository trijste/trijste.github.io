	<blogentry>I wanted to write yesterday, but work got in the way.  I was lying up on Scotty's couch trying to sleep, and could only think about strange things, so enjoyed it.  I wanted to write about this one time I went out to climb to the roof of my old public school.  I had one of those sweet and chewy molasses candys with the haloween wrapper, and I ate it on the top as I walked around the roof throwing tennis balls off and thinking about as much as I could.  These are strange times to take this shape.  I am not in an authorly mood, however as I have been insulted in some way (http://jennyelle.signmyguestbook.com), but I guess I did insult Jenny by telling her her diary sucked.  She was just never updating and it was a poor line af communication to have even presented as open.  Ah well.  An insult and one in turn, ain't that the way?  Working for good money this week, but a long day on Saturday when I spend the afternoon from 11:45 to sometime after sundown with my family to reiterate my sister's exodus to Australia to complete her master's study of whatever it is she is studying in biology.  Then I spend the night at work from nine to seven thirty in the morning.  so my day should be from 11:45 am to about 9:30 -10 am in the morning of the next day.  And seeing as I will be up before 11:45 which is when my ride is leaving, it will probably be a twenty-four hour wake up period.  I'm rambling on about something or other, which is probably why my diary was called 'drivel' by some insensitive fuck.  I'll pull through, though;  I'll pull through.  Today is a day of rest and relaxation.  I will play for two hours and breath smoke like a king.  </P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
