	<blogentry>so yesterday was christmas.  I wish I had something that I wanted to write about because of it but I don't.  Everything was great and beautiful.  I didn't connect with any sort of religious symbolism this year, or any sort of fat red suited men.  I stole most of my gifts for people, but thouroughly enjoyed seeing them recieve them and like them.  I love giving gifts.  I just didn't have the money or the desire to contribute to a dying system.</P><P>I got what I really wanted though.  A new pair of moccasins!  My older pair wore out through the pad under the toe, and I have them duct tapped for water resistence.  This new pair is nice--I think nicer than the first.  I'm excited for the thaw so I can start wearing them again.  I did get a lot of candy, though thank you not as much as I could have.  I'm going to give some of it away--gelatin reasons.  I've enjoyed gradually losing my sweet tooth, but it's a hard addiction to kick.  SUGAR SUGAR CHOCOLATE!  I had a hot choclate this morning with whipped cream on top and egg nog inside as an internal creamer.  It was good but right before I sat down to write this, I choked on a mouthful and spat it all over my computer screen.  I had to run down and grab paper towels.  </P><P>My grandparents gave me the mocassins.  They were from Saint Jacobs I think.  It would be nice if they were made by the menonites, but I don't know.  It's a romantic life.  I remeber Jesus' Son by Denis Johnson.</P><P>I still have gifts for Ashley from two years ago.  I guess I'm a moops!  I got a nice new pair of pants too, that I think I'll wear into the ground.  I love nice fitting pants.  They're a nice black corduroy.  I'm just typing now really, and that's no fun.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
