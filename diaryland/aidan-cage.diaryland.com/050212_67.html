	<blogentry>Dear The Voice</p><p>What a windy way to wear the world, warrior.  Wouldn't watering wayward worries wrap wounds with winter weather?  Walter wonders...</p><p>I shaved my face and look like a baby.  I miss the ugly pubic hair that grew from my chin--luckily, it will grow back in time.  I went to this high school valentine dance party at the 'Centre Acadien' tonight.  It was just me and three other weirdos from my group.  I dressed up spiffy with a jacket and scarf and boogied like a fresh master while young girls and guys oogled on.  Whack music but flicking great, and we are sure to be the talk of the town come Monday.  I danced so hard I popped a button off my shirt!  Wish you were here to hug me and laugh loudly, but am glad you are where you are doing what you're doing--which sounds so flooking incredible!  Will I be able to see mister famous when I get back, or will you be off in cloud city making dreams?  I am actually seriously proud and excited.  It just sounds like a super string of moment things lining up to create hype heaven, hero.  Fuck Marla city!  Does she know yet, and are you going to tell her what a shitty job she has been and always will be doing?  Eugene Levy!  I went to Italy with that guy's son!  I forget his name, but he looked a lot like him.  Keep me posted on all the happenings in all the departments.  I am getting a little frustrated in my own department.  Not much on the scene, but it all gets prettier as the days drift by.  I wake up like a rock every morning.  I refuse to beat myself up about it.  It wouldn't do me any good (catch all the inuendo?).  I am falling back on a fantasy I have of hiking into the woods with one of the girls to camp out and drink mickeys of fireball and gordon's gin on my 48 hours off.  'We'll be a lot warmer if we share a shleeping bag.'  HahaHA!  I love you.  I have a phone card so I'll try to call you before Tuesday to say hello.  NEW YORK CITY.  I want to go with you someday, so get to know the town while you're there.<br>I am definately getting experience, but my job is pretty moopsed up.  The best part is working with the clients, who are very very affectionate and hilarious; the worst part is the work I have to do, which will be painting lobster traps the colours of the Acadian flag--two coats each.  The highlights are that I'm learning how to knit socks, which is serious in my books.  Socks lead to gloves and sleeves of sweaters that I will learn to knit in time.  I'm getting pretty good at it, and will hopefully learn to crochet at some point.  I also just take my time and listen to the 720 AM oldies station that crackles in from PEI.  It's pretty relaxed actually, so I shouldn't shit all over it.  Next week I am one of the two weekly house managers, who cook three meals a day for the twelve people in the house and clean and shop and do dishes.  I'll get through it, and when I do I'll be starting half days at the museum doing that film editing work.  </p><p>Happy Birthday --> I'd send you a post card if I knew your address.</p><p>I drew a strange picture I'll show sometime.  The art up here travels strangley through the pens.  </p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
