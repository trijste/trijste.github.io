	<blogentry>I saw Farenheight 9/11 last night with Marie.  The day started with a doctor's appointment at the Clarke, which really sucked and pretty much brought my whole day down.  It sucks to sit in a room with someone who stares at you and asks you questions about strange things.  I talked to him about Katimavik, and he told me to go to a family doctor.  I talked to him about ODSP and he offered to send it in for me.  That was pretty much it.  No script because I had enough pills untill out next appointment.  I Just want the whole deal to end.  I hate the idea of taking meds for a long time, but that seems to be the only option for me right now.  </P><P>I went for a coffee afterwards with Kevin and Marie, who I met with at the Clarke.  Ben Norman came down town and had a coffee with me.  He's leaving for Europe on Monday--bastard!  I would like to take a nice long trip away from my pills and problems, but I have to give it time and let them do as they please and think best for me.  We played crazy eights, then left and Ben gave us a ride to a subway station.  We were about to get on and I said we shoudl see the movie tonight, since we had talked about it, so we walked to the Paramount and bought tickets.  Mine was &#36;14!  The movie was pretty interesting and obviously a strong political no for the bush administration.  Bush looked like such a fool.  The whole war scene was pretty horrific.  I hate seeing dead bodies and civilians crying.  I hope Bush doesn't get in a second run.  </P><P>After the film, we walked back to queen station and got on and rode to bloor and got off and transfered and rode to coxwell where Marie got off and I rode the train to warden.  I bought a lentil roll and a vegetable samosa and got on teh bus.  I read some of my book and ate and walked home.  At home I had a bowl of fruit salad and a piece of cheese with my mom.  </P><P>I've got some work coming up at the ACC for this Madonna show.  I'll be in the recieving area of the merchandise and helping out with the boxes and unloading.  It shoud be fun.  There's also some more film work for me to be a part of coming up, so I look forward to that.  I hope you are all well.</P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
