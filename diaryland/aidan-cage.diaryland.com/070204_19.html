	<blogentry>Enough time has passed, and enough smallness has happened for me to start in on an entry.<br>I was going to avoid the eighty plus dollars needed for my Sociology textbook by scanning in the whole thing.  I got it out of the reserve at the library only to find it far too voluminous to feasibly do.  I found out they got a new scanner in the media room that you can just drop your reserve files into and it converts them to PDF super fast and super well.  I debated and decided that it would be in my best interest to buy the text book.  As I looked at it, I found it had a lot of information packed into it, and if I was getting away with Scanning the readings on reserve, I didn't want to push a copyright suit into my life for a textbook.  I wandered over to the bookstore and found the section.  I reached to the shelf and pulled one off, but it seemed a little worn.  It clicked.  I took it over to the cash and the girl was like "Oh yeah, that got returned.  It's only sixty bucks."  Yo.  Awesome.  Sold.  Made my day.  Now I only have to read it, and all my other books.</p><p>I saw a movie last night called "Pan's Labyrinth" (a Spanish film), and it was totally incredible, highly recommended, and something I would even own to watch again.  A little extreme in some areas (Clockwork Orange springs to mind), but I found it to be like Henson's "Labyrinth," a Hemingway story, and something else I can't remember anymore.</p><p>I am heading out to do some work.  I really can't work in my room (or the same room I sleep in.  I am recognising that I need a place to buck up and do shit.  <br>I set up some things in my room (a towel under the window leak :|).  A pulled a nice looking folding screen up from behind the fridge.  I now have semi-privacy instead of an open viewing to my sad state of affairs.  <br>I also made a "To Do," and "To Sort" section on my little shelf thing.  This way I can feel better about stuff piling up.<br>I have pictures of these wondrous things, but I am late for a work date (with my books).</p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
