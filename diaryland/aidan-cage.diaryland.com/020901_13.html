	<blogentry>dropped acid last night.  two hits.  double dipped.</P><P>starting out so innocent so fun so ready to trip ready for anything cause I'm strong and ready for a good trip a mind fuck fantastic that I can really get into and really ride.</P><P>three million years ago I dropped the hits and headed out for my night on the fuck wave darting here and there, taking a swim at the royal york hotel, really feeling comfortable with Lou, Ricky and Jimmy, taxing a drink from subway and calling it ok, really getting into a game of sack, really feeling the walls ripple when you stare.</P><P>I guess it didn't really start to kick in until we got to the music gardens, which is perhaps the worst yet best place to trip out in.  The gardens themselves are beautiful, and Jimmy and I climbed ontop of the large metal spiral that covers a stage of somekind and played it till the wasps that were nesting there started to show there disaproval.  Then lying down and letting it take hold, watching the cloud-like chem-trails from the machines' planes pass through the air over and over again creating numerous spinal columns that instantaneously turned into jelly fish and danced around the sky for me.  This is the part that is fun.  Looking around at stuff and having it dance around for you.  Feeling the breeze on your face while feeling it on the water, trees, and grass around you at the same time.  looking at the water ripple and really seeing where the air and water meet, like oil and water, there are no gaps here in between things.  Everything is connected through its existence.  This concept held me up for awhile as the foot bag started to make more and more sense to me and I could just play it like an instrument.  Somewhere along the way back home, after leaving the city and before trying to sleep, I realised my flaw.  I'm on strong acid.  The nature of the drug tends to keep the mind up while letting the body fall behind.  My legs started to hurt, my stomach started to growl, but my brain was wired into the ACid line, and I couldn't keep up my light jog like I used to.</P><P>I really don't know if I'm writing sense right now or not, so please bear with me as I clear out some analysis.</P><P>I think that a large part of my conscious thought is dedicated to interpreting metaphors and micro/macrocosmic scales, so when I started to wear down, I started to think about my life outside the trip, and I started to get a little of the fear.  I'm growing older, and I have no plans.  I'm living at home, and going to school for film, but even that is something I don't consider direction.  I had reached a block in my movement through life, and the acid pushed me to look at it for real and discover what the paths of choice could bring, both good and bad.</P><P>For whatever reason, my trip started to turn.  My mind started to take on a life of it's own.  I started to look at everything around me in as an objective view as possible, which only started to shut my communication abilities down.  I looked at everyone around me as I walked along harbour street, and saw them all as animals, and i don't mean they looked like squirrels.  They were human, but they were just animals, and now all the things they were doing, like window shopping and watching a klezmer concert, were just weird special entertainment.  SO here I am in my head completely, my brain is a glowing ball of light, and I am completely detached from the environment around me and very alone in my head.</P><P>We decide to go to Paul's to watch a movie, but we take way too long to get there, and are way to fucked to take it easy.  But I'm still fucked out of my head.  The movie starts and I have the worst angle on the screen as I'm sitting on the far right of the screen.  So I can't get into the story, and am left to just lie in my own mind fuck and chug a lug through time.</P><P>We finally callit a night, even though we're still mightly fucked.  and we head home to bed.  But I'm this animal with a brain and the two of the parts seem so disconnected, as if my brain and body were seperate beings, so as my body drifted off to sleep, my brain kept right on fucking.  I was very alone and starting to really get the fear.  but I know drugs come and go, it's just that acid is so intense that you are in a whole other world and you don't know if you can get back.  I actually did go to a new world.  I crossed through time to talk to myself tomorrow and let myself know it would all work out.  I went to the bathroom, and looked at my self in the mirror, and I was just this animal with a brain inside of my head.  I had completely retracted into a corner of my mind, and couldn't throw off the drug.  I lay in bed and tried to answer questions that ripped through the fabric of my understanding.  I watched myself fall asleep, then wake up again then fall back asleep.  I was very very messed.</P><P>But through the fear came a new idea.  Slow it all down; all of it.  Just take things one step at a time.  I can't lie in my bed here and decide what I'm going to spend my life doing in each tiny detail.  I have to let that unfold in steps like days.  Time is it.  and I gradually nodded off.</P><P></P><P>I woke up too early with a bit of it still in my head.  even when I started this entry, there was still a bit in there.  but I let my life come rushing back in to fill the drug void, and I made some strong commitments towards not using drugs anymore, because I really don't want to do them.  I want to live my life as it happens, but I want to give all I have to my goals.  When I take drugs, they wipe my mind clean like a piece of slate, and my direction shifts under the weight of an empty head.  My life is exciting enough, I don't need drugs anymore.  My foot is down.  I also want to head in a few directions I've breezed past, so I guess I can make it through.  Did I mention I cried this morning, and I don't mean I let a tear drop from my wet eyes, I mean I balled it all out of my head and body.  I just blew all the fear out as well as I could.  If I couldn't cry, I would have no release.  I can't believe you read this dribble this far.  There is no running syntax through this entry.  It is just my own faucet opening up to pour out what ever clogged the pipes last night.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</P><P></P><P>PS  today, things are still a little mixed up.  I went really deep inside last night and I think I brought out a lot of things to my conscious mind that weren't quite so prevalent before.  I have a lot of love to give and I feel like sometimes I just don't give it out enough.  I feel kind of bad that I havn't been a better person, but this is helping to fuel my abstinance from drugs.  I love you so much.  I love you so much.  I love you so much...</blogentry><BR><BR>
