	<blogentry>The venue was nice.  I liked the little stage with the kicking jazz band, and the fact that Nell knew that I knew the singers cousin.  I think I got really drunk really fast.  I knew they would be feeding me shot after shot after shot after pitcher, but I didn't feel it gradually come over me.  I felt it keck me in the face.  I never pretende to be a big fan of alcohol, but I figured I would let myself be entertained by myself just for tomight.  Things got a little weird at points -- there was some older lady I didn't know who thought she'd like to get to know me, but she was drunk too.  I chose my escape route not to badly.  I went left when Matt and Steve were taking me right into a new bar with new people and new drinks I didn't really want.  And then I went home when Paul, Ashley, and Carter stopped off at Will's.  I snuck out to head back with Liam, and he dropped Jonny, Brendan, and Will off while I dropped all the alcohol in my system onto the pavement as it flew by.  I got home early with a huge buzz, and crashed into my bed feeling like I had done the right thing.  I let my instinct guide me, and it all really worked out well.  I don't think I'll be going to a bunch of bar's now that I'm 19, but I think it's nice to not be restricted anymore.  The Rex was hardcore -- a real jazz spot.  I'd go back there everynight.  Hope nobody was too pissed off that I didn't do things their way last night, but I think everything worked out for me.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
