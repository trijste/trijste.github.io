	<blogentry>It has been a while, but I should report.  Things are going along with my appeal.  I recently wrote a two page response to a list of five or six questions and have yet to hear back from Louise, who is handling the case.  Other than that garbage, I am really starting to enjoy my summer in the city.  Ben and I are busy searching the 'central' district for a place come august/september.  I am swimming all the time at the wonderful, free pool at Bathurst and Dundas.  I am part of a hardcore canoe trip up in temagami next week!!  I am planning some and socializing.  I have lots to do towards comfort.  I need to draw more and play more and write more, but I have just been busy and occupied.  I want to take an east trip in august, but I need to settle into the city.  I want that warm, elusive friendship.<br>Friday, June 24, Liam and I went out for a fine dining date at Thuet on King.  Jonny works there and seemed to hook us up mad in many departments.  It was a wonderful meal and not nearly as expensive as we thought, but once again we got a serious hook up on account of Liam being family.  After our superb supper, we cabbed back up town to Massey Hall for the incredible Sonny Rollins show.  I have never and probably will never again experience anything like watching that jazz legend and master virtuoso of the tenor sax play with his kickin' band.  I only wish I could have seen Arthur there.  I'm not sure that I will be able to afford lessons unless I get something under the table in the fall.  <br>Things are peaceful.  My mom has flown to Jersey to see my sister (not New Jersey), and I am going up to see my grandparents on the tree farm this weekend.  I have been absorbing the second season of the X-Files on DVD curtesey of my sister's boyfriend buying it for her.  I love that show so much more when I don't have to sit through commercial breaks. <br>I have a lot of dreams of plans floating around that don't seem to settle into practical practice.  I keep pushing their manifestation further ahead in time when I get settled into a routine.  I have little more to say other than Ashley's place is beautiful; she and Dion are awesome, and write me something to say hello.</p><p>LOVE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
