Before I start those, however, I have decided to do a pair in the style of the Acadian flag for the Green Door to sell.  I may just give them to Sam.  I am a much more confidant knitter, but lack the finess to freestyle on my needles.  I will learn to improve as I go.<br>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
