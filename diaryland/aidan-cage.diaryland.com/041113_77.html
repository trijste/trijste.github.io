	<blogentry>I booked and bought my ticket today for my trip to Peurto Vallarta from December 12 to the 19.  It was not cheap, coming in at &#36;1274.  Whatever.  I save my money for no real reason, other than I can't think of things worth spending it on, so here's something of value:  a week in Mexico with my best friend.  <br>I went to a free dinner on Wednesday.  It was a co-op dinner for four different co-ops attached to the U of T.  I have a couple girl friends in one of the co-ops and they invited me to come.  It was really nice.  I arrived earlier than I thought and saw through the front window that there were far too mny people for my social comfort level, so I waited in a park for a while and walked in later.  My friends were there and seemed surprised and happy to see me.  I got served a vegan meal of bean cakes, this great curry rice with raisons, and a salad with pomegranet seeds.  Very tasty and filling.  I felt like I should help clean up, but I was told not to, and that there were people there who had that duty.  We went back to their house and had coffee.  My friend Liz made a fancy coffee with soy milk foam and cinnamon.  I sat and chatted, then went for a walk with beautiful, blue-haired Caitlin.  We walked and talked around the fancy houses and up to the train tracks where we climbed up onto one of the parked train cars and sat for a while just watching the night.  I plan to make it a part of my weekly schedule.  Caitlin and I went to the Green Room, where Jonce was working, but we didn't stay.  I introduced her to Jonce and they saw they had met before.  We left and I bought some strawberry iced soy dessert for Caitlin and her house.  I'm working on a CD for her, but I'm having a hard time feeling uot what she would like from what she wouldn't--should be a good mix.<br>Thursday I went to the Driving Test Center at Vic Terrace and took my G1 written test.  I passed.  I am now a new driver, though I still havn't done any driving other than a mower tractor up at my grandparents tree farm.  It will come with time as my nervousness seeps away and my skills take over.  I am nervous, though.  I don't want to kill anybody, and you're basically driving around a bullet.  Oh well, maybe I can get more film work when I get my license.  I have to learn how to drive one of those cube trucks.  <br>Other than that, my sister get's home next Saturday, I have an appointment with my psych on Wednesday (after which I'll go for that fancy dinner again), and I leave for Mexico after my exams.  When I get back, I'll be working and trying to do my christmas shopping, and if everything works out I'll be broke just in time to leave for seven months to Katimavik.  I still don't know where I'm going.  The information package hasn't arrived.  I'm pretty sure she said my medical passed and that I was accepted.  I'll find out soon enough.</p><p>Hope you are all doing well.  Drop me a note.</p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
