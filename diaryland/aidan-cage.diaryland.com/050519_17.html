	<span class="title"><blogtitle>earthship proposal</blogtitle></span>
	
	<div class="body">
	<blogentry>This is a proposal meant to spark interest in the forward moving technologies of appropriate housing.  It is a brief summary of some main ideas as garnered from the Internet, with links and websites that can lead to further exploration of the earthship concept.  It is presented to Rodney Sidlo*** by Tristan Stei*** of the 2005, April to June trimester of the Katimavik program.  The real hope is for this to lead to more research on line.  Once you start to see actual photographs of these beautiful homes, and hear testimonials from builders, it is difficult not to get excited. <br><BR>'Earthship' is a term for a home concept designed by architect Michael Reynolds.  The earthship is a structure which utilizes the concepts of thermal mass (a very dense material which can hold heat or the lack of it for long periods of time), passive solar gain (which is the acquiring of heat from the sun without using any outside inputs) and heat ventilation (the process of eliminating heated air from an environment using skylights).  The thermal mass is derived from automobile tires laid on their sides, not on the tread, pounded with approximately 300 lbs of dirt, accomplishing a 3-foot thick wall, 10-12 feet high with large amounts of thermal mass.  The tires are stacked like bricks, prior to being pounded, and formed into a large, single U-shaped structure or several smaller connected U's.  The exposed side, or upper side of the U, faces south in the northern hemisphere and vice versa in the southern.  It becomes a wall of vertical glass thus achieving passive solar gain.  Operable windows and angles can be incorporated within this 'greenhouse' structure.</p><BR><p>Within each room or U, an operable skylight is installed to aid in heat release.  Shades are also used to block out unwanted sun and insulate from heat loss at night.  The roof is also well insulated with a typical R-factor of 60; three times the industry standard.  The tires are insulated on the outside of the U and earth is piled up around the outside of the U extending at least 8 feet around, creating a berm.  In drier climates, the bottom half of the U is an excavated earth cliff and the top half is the tire U bermed with soil as described above.</p><BR><p>The tires on the interior are sealed via adobe plaster to prevent off gassing due to oxygen and sunlight.  The water to the earthship can be harvested from the propanel roof and stored in a cistern for pressurization and filtration.  All water except toilet water is then fed to plants grown within permanent rubber-lined planters along the glass face of the house.  The end result is odorless and clear water pumped to the toilet.  It is then drained to a solar-assisted septic tank with outdoor planter similar to the indoor ones.  These evaporate and digest the sewage.  Some earthshippers grow copious amounts of food in the planters, as all the conditions, light, warmth, water and nutrients are plentiful.<br><BR>The Earthship home is really a great alternative to living in a box structure dependent upon outside resources for life support.  The concept is still a long way from mainstream but it is strongly felt that it is the best way to go if you want a house that will take care of you, and your philosophy includes not using up anymore of the earth's resources than necessary.  The evolution of these houses has taken over twenty years.  Catch water, photovoltaic electricity, solar mass and a water filtration system that reuses water three times are components of this type of home.  Maybe you can join in the process of creating a better world!  <br><BR>Links<br>http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/earthship.htm --> an excellent site with photographs, drawings, information, floor plans, and other ideas on sustainable building.<br>http://d.webring.com/hub?ring=earthships --> a web ring which lists many important sites that offer information on earthships.<br>http://www.sci-scotland.org.uk/whatis_earthship.pdf --> a comprehensive proposal by an UK organization with information on promoting affordable housing.<br>http://www.sanjuancountry.com/personalpage/oneyear.html --> a well written and very informative look at actually living in an earthship.<br>http://www.sanjuancountry.com/personalpage/Whyes.html --> a list of important reasons for wanting to build and inhabit an earthship.<br>http://www.touchtheearthranch.com/tirestart.htm --> a site that has useful information on the process of working with tire walls.</p><p> &#1645;http://www.sanjuancountry.com/personalpage/construction.html --> some information written on specific areas of house building from folks who have experience building their own earthships--summarized below<br><BR>Land for building the house:<br>A south slope with a gentle gradient is best.  If you can find a site with drainage away from all sides that is the best.  We have one that drains away from three sides.  If you plan to go off the grid and stay with the self sufficient concept look for land without utilities; it's a lot cheaper.<br><BR>Excavation:<br>No surprises except to pick a site with good drainage and as few rocks as possible.  We know of one couple that had to abort their project due to blasting cost.  We worked hourly with an excavator but our foreman kept the machine rolling.<br><BR>Tire Walls:<br>The most intense part of building the house--very labour intensive and hard work at that. Hire a consultant at the least.  Level each course and each tire in each course and pack the tires really well. Use a "Pogo Stick" or compressor driven jack hammer tool.  You'll need a special head and a large compressor.  We employed three high school seniors and a variety of adults including Tim and myself part time.  It took a month.  Once this is done you are well on your way.  It's the biggest hurdle, job wise.<br><BR>Framing, Including Walls:<br>No problem with the framing.  Just use a good carpenter because you are working with some weird angles.  One caution: be sure your framing for the greenhouse goes in right or you could have windows cracking at the corners due to the torque.  We did the end walls in straw bale and the bathroom and laundry area walls using a rammed straw/mud technique.  The shower is can walls.<br><BR>Water Stuff--Cisterns, POM and WOM and Roof:<br>Read the books if you don't know what these are.  First, get poly cisterns!  All four of our cement units leaked and we had to remove them and replace them with polys that work great.  The manufacture, Associated Precast out of Montrose, bought back their cement products and removed them for us.<br>We bought both our modular systems from SSA in a package deal.  The WOM is fine although we still need to paint our roof with a potable material.  We used EPDM not Hypalon due to the many curves of the back wall.  Metal would not have worked due to the pitch and our snow load.  I still question if we will get enough water but that's because we moved in the beginning of the dry season!  I have a small tank on my truck as a back up to help get through these times but we are very careful how we use the water.<br>The POM was a different story.  We had to send it back to SSA because it didn't meet the national electric code.  I believe now they have corrected the problem for Colorado systems.  SSA is working with the credit they own us by providing other product of equal value.  It has taken a year to get back about 80% of our money in other products but so far they are keeping their promise.  Be really clear about what you want and check with your electrical inspector before hand.  Our inspector was a real tough person to work with but our electrical system including the PV is well done.  That is the up side.  By the way, be sure you size the system based on you needs.  Ours is small but it works great.  The cost is still high for these PV systems but it is getting better.<br>One note about the roof--it is critical that you put up a good vapor barrier and lots of ventilation under the roof.  These houses have high moisture content due to the plants so you have to ventilate or the water will condense and leak.<br><BR>Windows and Glass:<br>We used a Velux egress window for our front instead of the dormers and these work great.  They open upward and have a sliding screen.  The standard dormers work okay but block the view too much.  For the vertical windows in our kitchen we used Eagle casement windows that open from the bottom out.  No problem with the wind catching them.  For the skylights we used the largest unit Velux makes--4 by 4.  This unit can be opened to allow heated air to escape.<br><BR>Alternate Heating:<br>Just a wood stove because we have lots of wood and about 300 sunny days a year. Let's see how it goes this winter.<br><BR>Solar Hot Water Heating:<br>We are using an Aquastar - on demand heater.  It works great. We have a Solahart unit now installed on the roof that heats the water using solar but the manufacturer sent it with many parts missing.  Solahart sent us the parts free of charge so they are seem okay as a company to work with.  The unit now seems to be working well, or let me update that by saying it works great!  Our water is so hot we have to dilute it to use it!  The unit is definitely efficient if you get enough sun and the tank is so well insulated it will keep the water warm for days even when you have cloudy weather.  Since there are no moving parts I would assume the unit will last a long time but we shall see.<br>Storage is important.  Put it everywhere you can.  It makes the house more functional.  We used all rough sawn wood for the rustic look.  Appliances include the SunFrost refrigerator, a simple Whirlpool propane oven/stove with pilot lights, and the Equator washer and dryer.  All work great!  We used Celbar natural paper bulk insulation in the ceilings.  There is no fiberglass and the cost wasn't much more, but you need an insulation machine to get the job done.  We rented one from the local lumber yard.</p><BR><p>General Observations:</p><p>So far we love it.  You are so aware of the weather and nature around you and this is so much of what we are to our very core beings.  The house is really like an organism and we don't even have the planters fully functional!  Be aware of one thing; if you live a high pressure, no time for anything life style this is not the house for you. We are retired and have the time to adapt to what the sky gives us.  You have to adapt to good old Mother Nature like we used to for thousands of years.  That can be a hard lesson for the modern day yuppie.  There is limited water and power and heat and you have to live with it!  Are you really willing to work some each day adjusting ventilation, watering plants, checking the power levels, and spending time just looking outside into the beautiful world we live in?  Keep in mind you won't have to spend time writing checks to utility companies!<br><BR>Building the house was a real challenge compared to standard construction but I can honestly say it was worth the time and money.  It gives you a real sense of purpose in a world where resources are running low.  We lack for nothing but we are aware of the resources we use; it fits with our philosophy.  You do work harder to keep up on things but that gets better as you learn what works and doesn't work.<br>The best appliances can be chosen from a source that sells these types of products, like Jade Mountain in Boulder, CO.  Propane fridges are good also, but they tend to come in smaller sizes.  David Knapp also has a tremendous list of sources.  We have a 16 cubic foot sunfrost which works on DC.  It has dual compressors and lots of insulation.  It works great!  For a washer/dryer, the Equator model works great.  It uses only 15 gallons for water a cycle and spins dry the clothes so well you only have to hang them out to dry for a short while.  There is an electric drying cycle and we use it only on a good sun day.  For a stove we have a whirlpool model that uses propane pilot lights and not glow plugs.  This means no power draw.  Also there are no digital parts like clocks and timers on it.  Get rid of all digital stuff or put a surge protector on off switch on it like your stereo and computer.  We use a 1.6 gallon toilet.<br><BR>If you are somewhat serious regarding the task of building a house like this, visit the Lean-green Consulting Site (http://www.earthshipconsultant.com ).  Robert Revel, who recently finished a beautiful 'state of the art' earthship, is willing to help others in the design or any aspect of their project.  Another alternative for the architectural work and consulting is the EDGE Architect Group (http://www.edgearchitects.com ). <br><BR>For lots more information, also check out David Knapp's Web Site (http://www.geocities.com/renewables/earthshp.html ), which has extra information on alternative building.<br></blogentry><BR><BR>
