	<div class="body">
	<blogentry>This is just some more bulk crap that I can put on my diary, but if you like the movie Pi, you might be interested in my critique of it.  I had to do a film critique for my portfolio for the course I want to take at the IAOD next year, and here she is … </P><P><HR></P><P>	Pi is an independent film directed by Darren Aronofsky.  It stars Sean Gullete as Max Cohen, a mathematician who is looking for a pattern in the stock market.  The movie is based on circles, more specifically the golden spiral, and pi.  The film is extremely well done; everything about the movie relates and feeds back into the theme of order in chaos, and the golden spiral.</P><P>	Pi is shot in black and white, but this does not distract the shot structure from the theme.  The black and white film actually enhances the idea of the simplicity of the circle.  It is quite paradoxical to portray the the maddening complexity of the search for order, purpose, and reason in the universe on such an easy-going, low key medium like black and white film.  It sets the mood for the film almost immediately, and helps to focus the viewer's attention on the ideas being conveyed, as opposed to the colour of the paint on the walls.</P><P>	The circular sequence of the shot structure acts as a metaphor to plaster the main theme onto the viewers image receptors.  The idea of the golden spiral is emulated in the design of the shots.  The golden spiral, or a singular idea growing in intensity, can be found in Max's migraines, Max's narrative, Max's pill taking, Max's phone ringing, Max's computer work, and Max's encounters with the Hasidic jew, Lenny, and the business women, Marcy.  The over all impact that these metaphors, or microcosms of the central theme, create is that of brilliance, both in the character of Max Cohen and in the the direction of Darren Aronofsky.</P><P>	Along with the metaphors, the viewer finds a plethora of circular imagery.  The circles are reiterated constantly in the peep hole through which Max views the world outside his apartment, the Go board on which Max faces Sal, the rotary phone which Max never seems to answer, the light holes on the stock exchange that Max studies constantly, the cream that swirls in the coffee that Max drinks, and the smoke that curls in the air that Max breathes.</P><P>	The film is left quite open to interpretation, which only adds to the magic one is left with after viewing it.  Pi is a well crafted movie right down to the truancy of the concepts it portrays, and the mystification of an answer without an answer.</P><P><HR></P><P>And there she was … if you liked that, or even if you didn't, you should check out my philosophy project on wether one can justify belief in God or not.</P><P>You can access that here … <BLINK><A HREF="God.html">PHILOSOPHY</A></BLINK></P><P>That's it for now, kids, so have yourself a safe day in the summer …</P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
