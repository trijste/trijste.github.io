	<div class="body">
	<blogentry>there is a feeling hand placed just below my chest, with a thumb up between my bosom and a palm pressing slightly on my ribs--the apex of the hollow 'A.' It makes me feel irrational because it tells me to stop, wait, think before you act, be careful or I will push it out your eyes painfully, one wrong move and I will be here forever, whenever you think of it:  whenever you feel of it.  It presses harder sometimes, and sometimes it lets go.  It is hot, like burning fat, and oily so I can feel it slide around--breaking me out like chocolate.<br>Something placed it there, this hand.  Some thing or word or thought or impression or feeling or action or one--this has a source and, please, it must have a destination.  It must, or I am to be felt by it for too long now.  To find the destination, and from there to see the source--perhaps that can be placed second or third on my 'to do' list.</p><p>LOVE - Tristan</p><p>PS-I stumbled into Sam's today after roaming Yonge with Stacey as a Christmas shopping mate.  I was wanting to jog up to the folk section, but I entered through the classical door.  I thought of Debussy, and wanting to know more of him--his compositions mostly.  A girl met me and asked, so I said, and she pointed, and we talked, and smiled and talked off topic--jazz, playing, learning, instruments, names, finally.  Deanna, or that sound.  Nice girl.  A good friend to make on the turn of instant.  Three for two on the 'eloquence' line of release, so two Debussy discs, and one Rachmaninov (piano concertos).  <br>The one I'm listening to is nice (does that help describe it?)--fucking beautiful and full of feeling, then.  I am pleased with my perchases of the day.  I got a lot covered, and once the first session is done there is an ease in the ones that follow.  There is nothing like sitting on your gifts through the season.  I would love, for once, to be finished before the eve of the twenty-fourth.  I borrowed the second season of 'Six Feet Under' from Kyla, and I am looking forward to watching it at mom's home with tea and hot chocolate and Josefina, and whoever else wants.  I don't know if I have already seen the whole season while it was running, but at least I will have something commercial-free to watch.  <br>Tomorrow doesn't need to be a big day, but it feels me with the hand.</p><p>PEACE</blogentry><BR><BR>
