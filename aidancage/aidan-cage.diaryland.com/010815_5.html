	<blogentry>Maybe I'll spill a little on this one.  I hardly ever just write a diary for the sake of just writing an entry to clear my head -- or is that all I did for a month?</P><P></P><P>Either way, I just want to get some shit off my brain...</P><P></P><P>where should I start?</P><P></P><P><H4>Work</H4></P><P></P><P>I have been working about twenty five hour weeks since I got back from Italy.  This isn't a bad thing, as I have had no money, and will have no money until Friday, but it means that my life has now started to revolve around work.  This is a bad thing.  I hate to say it, but every day I find that I don't really need a lot of money, I can live without the needless fast-food lunches, the iced caps, and the cigarette addiction, but I realize these things when I'm at work trying to fill the hours with &#36;7.51.  This makes no sense.  I don't want my life to revolve around work, or money.  I figured out that this is why I never really hated school as much as I thought I did.  When I was at school, I was revolving around school, and not work.  The only problem with this is that I hated the fact that my life revolved around school.  I guess I just don't want my life to revolve around anything, is that such a problem?  Well, how is it possible?  The whole situation is reminiscent of Decartes meditations.  My life revolves around nothing, therefore it revolves.  It is inescapable.</P><P></P><P><H4>School</H4></P><P>I have yet to finish my portfolio for my IAOD registration.  I just have to finish drawing my pictures for my storyboard.  I don't know why I havn't finished yet, but I think it is because I'm afraid to try.  School frightens me.  I think that, because I have always put in a "B," and always got out a "B," I will somehow not get what I need out of this course.  I have it all planed out, but I am just not doing it.  Why?  I will do them tomorrow.  I will do them tomorrow.  I will.  I need to try really hard in this course.  I can't just slack off and pass like I did for four years.  I need to realise that this course is for me and not the province of Ontario.  This is for my future.  I guess I just don't want my life to revolve around my future.  FUCK!</P><P></P><P><H4>Friends</H4></P><P>I really want to spend time with my friends, but I don't have enough money to do all the things I want to do.  I need to work to make money.  When I work I don't get to see my friends because I'm working.  What the fuck happened?</P><P></P><P><H4>Girl</H4></P><P>She is never around, and never really will be.  I like her more than anyone, but I just don't know what to do anymore.  What am I doing?  I can't end anything.  It all hurts me too much.  I can't even think about it without a welt forming in my throat.</P><P></P><P><H4>Cigarettes</H4></P><P>Passive suicide, thanks I think I will.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
