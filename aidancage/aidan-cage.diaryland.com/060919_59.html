	<blogentry>I went in to chat with my english prof about the essay assigned.  We ended up just talking.  I am better off for writing the essay now.  I am even procrastinating now!  I want to do a draft tonight, but I am still at the campus typing this.<br>It is getting colder.  The sky today is grey like winter.  <BR>Of all my classes, I am enjoying Religious Studies most.  This is due partly to there being no homework as of yet, aside from reading, and also that the content interests me.  I spoke about Castenada to the prof after class one day, and she laughed and said that he was a phony who wrote every word from the Carleton Library to make money.  I smiled and said I hadn't been as sure.  She said that was quite fine, but then she said something strange:  Be careful with those books.  That I will.<br>She reminds me of myself in as much as I have done institutional time.  Some things she says bring back memories of insanity--not in the content, but in her anecdotes and asides.  I have caught myself thinking of how fun it would be to hang out with Matthew once again, and laugh over a beer about how we once drank each other's urine diluted in coffee or water.  Pure insanity and synchronicity--not like we toasted over it to our better health.  In any case, I have lost that contact, and my chances of return--even visit--dwindle in each sunrise.  Good riddance.<br>Everything else is smoothe, or undergoing a smoothening process.  Megan is vacillating still, and I am still sleeping on a chain of five pillows, three of which are from the couch downstairs (the other two having been bought for seven dollars a pair at Dominion)--I have a couch pillow and a pillow proper under my head, an orange blanket from the living room over that on which I lie, and an unzipped sleeping bag as a comforter.  I usually wake up stiff with my shoulder on the rug and the zipper marked somewhere uncomfortably.  My bed is dated to arrive on the thirtieth.  I have a desk, but it is dirty and in the living room with my bedside table, both of which were not promised to me but were left by the previous tenant.  I have no chair as of yet, but my mind is set on a kneeler.  I need some fabric for a window cover, and I want to plastic all the windows to save on power in the winter.<br>I fear my roomate is not as responsible with the litter box as he needs to be.  I peered in once to find it full of turds.  The litter gravel was three inches deep and the bottom inch was wet and smelled of ammonia.  I had to hold my breath as I scooped and churned.  No wonder there was shit on the bottom stoop, though he and his girlfriend ripped up the urine soaked particle board this weekend.  I may try to freshen the litter today.  The cat has taken a liking to me, but I still try to push it off so it won't be possesive when Josie comes to town.  <br>It is nearly time to trek home and start typing for class--not for me.  Freshies abound.  I am hungry.  <br>I am going to make my yummy pasta tonight.  I steam/fry sweet potato in with my onions, then mix them into a sauce with oven roasted vegetaballs. Cook the pasta and plate, then cover with sauce, simulated bacon bits, blue cheese, and voila!  <br>soooo hungry.  I wasted my time this morning.  I only got a tea and three packs of instant oatmeal in me before my one o'clock class.  Balls.<br>I'll eat some granola with grapes and yogurt at home, or a salad.<br>Look at how much I can write when I am ignoring my work.<br>moops!</p><p>LOVE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
