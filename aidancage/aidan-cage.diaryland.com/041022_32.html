	<blogentry>My internet's been down for a while.  Now it is back up.  The cable line was split underground or something, but it got fixed by the cable guy.  My furnace was off for a while too, but now it is back on and heating this house.  I worked on a set the last two nights doing best boy for Barry.  It was a student shoot, but hopefully I made a couple contacts out of it.  I may have some more work this week, but it's hard to say right now.  <br>I started working at the Bodyshop at Don Mills center in the stock room.  It's a super convenient part time job.  My mom's my boss and I help out with shipments and unpacking and bringing stock into the store.  There are some cute girls to flirt with too, which makes any job just that much better.<br>I'm going to try writing again soon.  I'd like to write another short and see if Barry's interested in directing it or something.  It's the subway one, but I have some more ideas, which will be tough to shoot because I want some tunnel running.  I think it can be pulled off guerilla, because I did Lower Bay with an XL1 when Carter and I went for a visit.  I'm just going to write it without the logistics too much in mind and see how feasible it is when it's done.  I also need to get some of Jonny's input into it, because we were sort of working on it together, and he's got some great ideas for it, but I need to just sit down and do some brainstorming.<br>My short got accepted into the Portland Underground Film Festival, but they want a miniDV copy and four press screeners, which I don't really have.  I forwarded it to my would be producer to see what he says about it.  I also gave a copy of my short to Barry to see what he thinks.  It isn't that bad.  I really like the beginning and middle--mostly the middle--and not so much the end.  But I gots to write something new to see if I can still do it.  It's tough to do.  I'm also thinking of sending an essay into some youth magazine, but I need to edit it from it's final draft that I completed in grade eleven.<br>That's about it.  Halloween's coming up and I don't know where I'm going.  I want to dress up and be social on the weird night, but I havn't been invited to anything that sounds like it will be pretty good.  Who knows?  </blogentry><BR><BR>
