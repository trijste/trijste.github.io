	<blogentry>Why havn't I been updating?  There really isn't a reason that is a solid thought I can transfer into solid words and explain in a way in which my thoughts become your thoughts on the same subject.  I don't know why specifically.  I have been working, though not washing dishes anymore.  I am now doing coffee bar and lunch service at a bakery around yonge and eglinton.  I am starting to tire of it already.  The work itself is not hard, and if I only had to come in and do the work--like it was when I was dish washing, it wouldn't be so bad.  But it is more than the work now.  I have to worry about the business too--and fuck business.  They want me to close the store alone and do all the stupid money math and I just can't be bothered to really care wether the numbers work or to even learn how they should work.  They are meaningless symbols to me.  They are part of a language that begins to describe a realm of reality that I do not care to exist on.  I'm going to quit and hitchhike east instead of west.  People I know are heading that way.  I know people that are heading west too, but I'd rather head east.  I can hit the protests along the way and try to find a piece of myself that my thoughts are unable to touch and feel and develop ideas about.</P><P>My trip to Israel fell through.  There weren't enough seats booked on the flight, so I got bumped off the super cool adventure trip I wanted to scam. They offered me some other weaker community based trip that left later on in the month of June, but I said no.  If I'm scamming a free trip to Israel, I want the best damn trip I can get--even if I have to wait a whole year for it.</P><P>I smoke weed.  I smoke weed every day.  I don't know what else to say about it other than just to document it for myself and others.  It is quite a habit I have picked up and the place it takes me when I smoke it is not so interesting anymore.  I am know just keeping a habit.  I don't feel good or bad, but I continue to smoke.  I have taken to climbing things when I smoke weed, so I can get high physically as well as mentally.  This keeps it fun and lets me take myself to the solitude that I feel in my head.  When I walk around and see all the people on the street, I get this funny feeling of disbelief, like I just don't believe they all exist.  Sometimes it is just that I don't care.  When I get high--like climbing onto a roof or into a tree, they all disappear and I am reminded of my mental landscape.  Does the pot make me feel that way, or do I just feel that way?  In anycase I am feeling something like bad these days.  Hopefully I'll find something tangible that I can hold onto and have lift me for longer than the short spurts of happiness I get from feeling the sun on my skin.</P><P>Today I am off to Shout to work on this video project.  I don't really want to work on it anymore because I know it's going to suck and that I wont care.  I have some ideas for a script that are starting to work towards coming together.  I'd like more time to ground them.</P><P>My social life is in the same boat as my treeclimbing and roof jumping rituals.  I am rarely around anyone I have true feelings of love for.  I am either at work where I interact in a jaded happy way with everyone--customers and staff, or I'm at Shout doing meaningless interviews and film work, or I'm at home where I feel like the bonds with my family that should be so much stronger or falling apart.  Around this time of year I start to miss the cottage and my father and seeing his side of the family.  It is these times where I feel the fountain of emotion asking me if I want to put on a water show.  </P><P>The phone just rang and it was Liam and we talked for a bit.  It was a great conversation.  I feel better and will write later, but now I am late.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
