	<blogentry>landed loaded down in the deserted paved place--small airport Sydney.  The flight from Toronto was easy.  I met Jade--the girl I was told would be on my flight--and found her quite easily.  She is tall, half Scottish, half Indonesian, beautiful, and the first person I would meet from my core group of fellow volunteers I would be spending the next seven months with.  A good start.  She is now terribly sick and throwing up in the basement of our little house in Chéticamp, but that is another story.  I am tired of writing.  I have already written a whole group e_mail to probably all the people that read this diary.  Other people are probably waiting for the computer.  If you aren't on my e_mail list just send me an e_mail to aidan_cage@*****ver.com, or aidan_cage@h******.com and I will add you on.  I'll probably just end up copying and pasting those letters to this site, but I hope I have more to say on here than on there.<br>SO I landed in Halifax, met some more folks from my group--all nice people, and caught my short flight from Halifax to Sydney, NS.  It was in a vaery small twin engine, with propellers on each wing, and sat probably twenty to twenty five people.  I could see the view through the cockpit window and feel the engines through the seat.  Great experience!  We landed and I collected my beat up luggage.  Two people--Jade was one--didn't get their luggage and would have to wait till today.  There was a two to three hour bus trip after that that I was in and out of.  The trip took us into the night and we arrived safely at our new doorstep.  Today we had a couple workshops and toured a few of the volunteer environments we may have the opportunity to work in. <br>I have moved from sharing a room with three other guys to having my on little 'room' I created in a nook above the stairs.  It is super cool and comfortable.  I'll try to photograph it a little bit so you all can get an idea of where and how I was set up.  <br>I am listening to some Bruce Cockburn and living it up infront of the computer.  I have full e_mail and internet access, but am not yet allowed to use MSN, so write me and such.  I'll write again tomorrow or the day after.</p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
