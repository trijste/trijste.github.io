	<blogentry>summer suns setting.</P><P></P><P>floated out to the farm for a week and a half.  Really good to spend time with my grandparents and helping my aging grandfather out with different chores he wanted doing.  I worked an overnight shoot as a PA for this Nike spot, not exactly my  ethical choice, but I didn't know until I had already agreed to it.  Good connections out of it.  No pay, but I need the experience.  </P><P>The farm was great though.  A freshwater pond to swim in, trails to walk though the trees and the Bruce trail goes along the back fence, so I hiked one afternoon with my mom.  I worked on a couple jigsaw puzzles with my grandfather and practised my sax for them.  It sucks to come back to the city, but I need to get back in gear to move past this year.  What a mess!  I don't think I could have had a worse year, or don't want to know how it could get worse.  I started the year at the coatcheck room, and now I'm on meds to control my self.  I want to go back in time, but I con only move forward.  Next year will be better, already a trip planned for going west.  There was a trip planned for this year, but I had other things in mind when summer came. </P><P>I need to find out if I'm legally obligated to go to the clarke, because if I'm not I will stop going at some point.  They don't seem to want to do anything but keep me drugged, and that is a problem for me.  I'll have to try to get them to lower my dosage again, and if they don't I'll have to start cutting my pills soon.  </P><P>I was supposed to start a class at Seneca tonight at seven, but it got pushed back a week.  Thursday I start a class on interpersonal communication which I need to work on because I am too quite for my own liking.  It isn't that I'm shy, I just often feel I have nothing worth sharing.  </P><P>Tania is coming back into town tomorrow for a short while.  It will be good to see her again.</P><P>I miss everyone.  I am socially isoplated here in the burbs.  I might see Ben tonight.  I just want to get out of my house more often now.</P><P>Liz is coming back to the city and I would like to spend more time with her this year.  She is a good person.</P><P>Jenn's still on the island and I'll probably talk to her soon.  I missed not seeing her this summer...this summer...what an enchanting time for all.</P><P></P><P>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
