	<blogentry>I went out for a hot drink with Ben this afternoon.  He wanted to talk to me about the beat poets of the fifties to see if I would say anything smart.  We wrote a couple poems verse for verse after the picking.  Ben starts the first one, and I start the second.</p><p>The Beach</p><p>The Wind whistles through the waves as the sand gleams of the sun. <br>The air is fresh, the mind is clear and the soul is quietly singing a <br>song of freedom.<br>Here is the beach; that consequence of two opposites existing side by <br>side, so that they can not even be opposed.  Completely similar, yet <br>infinetly unmeetable, the waves claw at the land, and the land cries <br>out:  giving in.<br>Lost in a moment of time, society's anxieties melt into the sea. <br>Piece of mind is gained with a new breath of fresh air. Serenity is <br>found in the hearts of the free, the sun set in the west creating a <br>transcending feeling of the sublime.<br>Night falls, as it will, and only the stars come out.  The music of <br>the waves' lap at land greets the uncountable's entrance on the sky <br>stage.  All the twinkling tears alight this scene of strange unchange.<br>The stillness of nightfall speaks to the poets heart. He finds <br>himself singing his beautiful dream to the stars above. The mood of <br>the landscape inspires him true.<br>For this is truth.  Nothing lies on this beach that is not coming <br>from and returning to the sea--endlessly.</p><p><br>The Journey</p><p>I am the road.<br>I stretch out before me and blindly behind.  I am parted through wet <br>woods, burning away towards tomorrow.<br>I care not for yesterday for it is gone, I take my experiences to my <br>next destination so I may live in the moment for today. My personal <br>possesions are all I have, a bag on my back and boots on my feet. I'm <br>weary from the road my mind is tired but I know I must move on.<br>I let my thumb fuck the air.  Endless pairs of sunglasses pass by <br>with no sight.  I plead with myself to create the holy ride to come <br>pick me up and take me.  Please make her cute and young and wheeling; <br>make her go my way too fast; let her put me up with her and her mom <br>at some trailer-town-pit-stop for one holy night.<br>Then move on to a jazzy bar where live music is playing. A little <br>melody to stroke my beat up soul into a drunken haze of beautiful <br>song.<br>Making music with life's raw notation--my actions pushing time over <br>into rolling balls all bloodstained with blown blisters--footing my <br>fortune and coasting coast to coast. <br>The winds of change bring me to <br>where I was born, I feel battered and bruised so I rest my mind. I <br>wake up refreshed, so I move on:  forgetting my past, ready for my day.</p><p>Ben and Tris</p><p>PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
