	<blogentry>Mystic Journeys class yesterday.  Seems like it will be interesting, but not quite what I had in mind.  It is more about the new paradigm of thought that deals with auras and energy and homeopathy.  The teachers a little cagey, but it is deffinately something to do and worth doing.</P><P>I'm working the Phil Collins concert on Monday, so I can make some coin.  Dale called my house last night while I was at class, and I called hime back.  He still needs to confirm.  </P><P>I had a great film idea last night before I went to sleep, but I didn't write it down and I can't remember if it was any good.  All I have are some juxtaposed pictures that don't make any sense.</P><P>I've got some errands to run today.  I have to go get a money order for &#36;10US, so I can send out another copy of my film to a festival.  I've got three lined up to send out to three different festivals, so maybe I'll hear back.  I've also got to get some photos photocopied.  One for my grandfathers B-day, and two others to include as a press package with my films.  I've also got to clean the fish box, take a bath, shave, read, smoke, and wait for my mom to get home to end my lonliness and isolated feelings I get from my suburban habitat.  I have a lot of social desires, but lack the phoneing friends.  </P><P>I bought another pack of butts yesterday before a really good sax lesson.  It just reaffirmed how much I dislike smoking and want to quit.  I will soon.</P><P>I'm going up to the tree farm for the weekend, then I'm back down for a possible meeting Sunday night for the short I'm acting in.  I'm getting busier, which takes my mind off of the strange visions I had earlier in the year, but I'm still a bit lost and still a bit weakened by them.  I crave the easy days of before, where I would just do my thing.  Now I think too much about things and don't see reality the way I used to.  And I don't like what you've got me hanging from...</P><P>PEACE - Tristan</P><P><HR></P><P>if ever there was something to put peacefully inside and let it rot the mind awakening and foretelling early brothers not to cry why eden didn't die the world over turning factors cripple sadness from the ovaries of every little devil comnig clean at half to eight on every monday night date I find I'm losing all my mind on little sandwhiches and ryhme a buzzing comes up from my window of tools trimming grass and I should just get off my ass and start my day to waste away I only smoke in hopes of dieing as if it was not a sure thing and the fear of repitition makes my tears cry out and sing for if the all is but a circle and the prison it creates would mean I'm damned to live again and never truthfully awake.</blogentry><BR><BR>
