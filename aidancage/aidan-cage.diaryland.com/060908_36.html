	<blogentry>My friend Faye has sent me Djarums.  Wow!  so I am smoking them, but I am a non smoker.<br>balls.</p><p>PEACE - Tristan<BR><HR><BR>I went out for sushi last night to the only sushi place in St. John's.  It was no Oishi.  Friday night is my fish night, so I had a green dragon roll, steamed asparagus in a miso sauce, two pieces of inari, and a salmon sushi duo.  It was good.  I enjoyed eating it, but it reminded me of how spoiled I was in Toronto.  Oishi's rolls were generous, and cheap, and we had a bond of some kind--even through the language barrier that made it hard to connect instantaneously.  The salmon was not smoke, which I guess I am more used to, also not cooked.  It had a very smooth and creamy texture, with an aftertaste I have not been used to.  It stuck around on my pallet long after I had paid--&#36;28 not including the small cluster of change I left, thanking the waitress more than tipping her.  <BR>Megan is coming to stay!  I am glad to get her, and get her out of TO.  She wrote me last night/this morning about something unclear that happened to her the previous night.  It seemed to really affect her, but I have not heard in great detail what it was, and it would not be in my right to go into it here if I had.  <BR>It is my first weekend.  I am going to Dominion to get some pillows and a pot, and maybe some other things of comfort (maybe even some food).  I don't have a lot of space to carry things on my bike.  I'll take my big orange backpack.  I have a list of todos for these couple days.  Cleaning, laundry, homework, phone callse and postcards all seem possible in this period of free time.  I sent my philosophy prof a link to a documentary on zoophilia, which I am not sure was such a good idea, but it got me thinking about human nature.  Look for it on spikedhumor.com--animal passions.  I have little else to add.

PEACE - Tristan</blogentry><BR><BR>
