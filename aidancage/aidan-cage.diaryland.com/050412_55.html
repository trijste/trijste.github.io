	<blogentry>I have taken a sick day.  I woke up this morning in a feverish sweat. <br>  I was delusional.  I thought I was in a rock quarry of some kind <br>with big sheets of heavy flat rock on top of me.  Pieces were <br>breaking off and disappearing into the void.  It was six am.  I <br>jumped off my bunk and threw on some clothes.  My throat felt like <br>nerve-wired sand paper.  It hurt to swallow.  I took a vitamin and a <br>contact C and had some of the corn bread Brittany made with syrup and <br>milk.  It hurt going down but tasted sublime.  I lazed around on the <br>couches for a while and decided I would not go into work today.  I <br>called in and left a detailed message, then went back to bed.  I have <br>been fighting this fever/sore throat combo for almost a week now.  I <br>made a doctor's appointment for three o'clock so I'm just typing this <br>out before I go.<br>My work is fantastic, when I'm not incredibly sick.  I work at this <br>place called HELP International, of which I could find nothing <br>pertaining online, but it is a super cool job.  Basically it is run <br>between Kenya and Canada.  There is an exchange of ideas, <br>technologies, and work ethics that is helping to balance the rapid <br>loss of resources in both countries.  The technologies are waste free <br>and sustainable, so there is a lot of fiber board made out of <br>recycled papers.  There are some waste free toilets, and genious wyas <br>to grow a huge number of trees in a small space.  Also some grafting <br>of one tree to another to have the one produce the other's fruit, and <br>mud hut building, and roof thatching, and brick making, and stone <br>carving, and art interpretation.  It is physically demanding, which <br>is what I wanted, but also culturally stimulating and actually <br>interesting just in what the organization itself is doing.  I have <br>only worked one day before taking this sick day, but already I have <br>helped to build a small tropical greenhouse enclosure, which I assume <br>is being finished today.  I hope I am feeling better come tomorrow.<br>Other than work, we went on a small tour of the town and saw W.O. <br>Mitchell's house.  We also went to another town called Estevan, where <br>another group in our cluster is living, and met up with the two other <br>groups for a trip to some windswept rocks and a swimming pool.  It <br>was good for us to meet the other groups, as they had known each <br>other from their previous cluster, and we were the odd group out.  <br>They seem nice enough, and there are some cool people for sure, but I <br>miss the group from Sydney that I have grown to love.  They are in <br>Blind River now.  We call each other.<br>That is it.  We have plans to go to Regina on Saturday to tour some <br>museums and such.  I am focusing on getting better, and wondering <br>what will be prescribed for my symptoms.</p><p>LOVE - Tristan<br></blogentry><BR><BR>
